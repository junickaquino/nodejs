
Node JS
- is not a programming language.
- it is a runtime environment. That allows you to run JavaScript in a server.


npm install lodash
- Lodash makes JavaScript easier by taking the hassle out of working with arrays, numbers, objects, strings, etc.
    Lodashâ€™s modular methods are great for:

    Iterating arrays, objects, & strings
    Manipulating & testing values
    Creating composite functions


npm install -g nodemon
- nodemon is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application
     when file changes in the directory are detected.
